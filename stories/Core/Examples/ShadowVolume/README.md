# Shadow Volume Example

This example shows how to implement shadow volumes.

This implementation was based on Mikola Lysneko's implementation [here](https://github.com/stackgl/webgl-workshop/tree/master/exercises/stencil-shadows). But note that it has been cleaned up a lot, many comments have been added, and some bugs have been fixed.
