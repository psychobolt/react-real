# Pong Example

In this example, we implement a simple pong game.

The demonstrated features are: batching, and how you can implement a game loop in regl.

Note that the ball will probably go through the paddles once it goes very fast. So the game could abe a lot more stable. But in order to keep the example short and readable. we have refrained from fixing this.
